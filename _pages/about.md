Hi, welcome to my webpage! I am a Climate Sciences Ph.D. candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography working with <a href="https://rkeeling.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/"> Dr. Ralph F. Keeling</a>.

I am interested in exploring a broad research question: **How can we identify changes in climate and biogeochemistry systems using long-term measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>?** My research primarily employs a variety set of observations, including aircraft data and in-situ measurements, as well as complicate climate models and idealized models to explain the underlying mechanisms that drive climate change. 

To better understand how tracers like CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> can tell us changes in our earth system, I focus on addressing the following topics:

(1) How large-scale atmospheric dynamics redistribute atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>?

(2) How can we constrain surface CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> fluxes, from both land biosphere and surface ocean, using sparse atmospheric measurements?

(3) How can we constrain tracer transport (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>) from  (moist) static energy transport?

(4) How can we combine atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> measurements to study the biological activities in the surface ocean?

Details about my research can be found <a href="https://yuming-jin.github.io/ri/">here</a>.
